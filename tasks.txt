## Pending Tasks (By Priority)

### High Priority
- [ ] **Cloudinary Image Upload**
  - [ ] Implement secure upload functionality for payment proofs
  - [ ] Add backend handling for pre-signed URLs
  - [ ] Include validation for file type and size (max 2MB)
  - [ ] Add image preview and removal functionality

- [ ] **Organization Switcher UI**
  - [ ] Implement Clerk's <OrganizationSwitcher /> component
  - [ ] Ensure clear visual indication of active organization
  - [ ] Add organization context throughout the application

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Reporting System (/report)**
  - [ ] Create aggregated reports from transaction data by organization
  - [ ] Implement report types:
    - [ ] Monthly/Yearly Summaries
    - [ ] Category-based Reports
    - [ ] Period Comparisons
    - [ ] Related Party Analysis
  - [ ] Add export functionality (PDF/Excel)
  - [ ] Implement print capability

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Enhanced Transaction Actions**
  - [ ] Add Print Detail functionality
  - [ ] Implement Download pdf Invoice feature
  - [ ] Create receipt/invoice templates

## Implementation Notes
- All queries now filter by both organizationId and userId to ensure data isolation
- Added type extensions to handle fields not yet recognized by TypeScript
- For transactions and items, used type assertion to handle the new fields when TypeScript doesn't recognize them
- Test coverage is basic; should be expanded to cover all API endpoints
- Added proper error handling for cases when user is not authenticated or no organization is selected
- Used temporary type casting (prisma as any) for new models until Prisma client is regenerated

## Technical Debt
- Need to regenerate Prisma client types to properly include organizationId and userId and master data models
- Consider creating a helper function to handle the common auth checks across all API routes
- Improve type safety rather than using 'any' type assertions
- Add integration tests for the user+organization permission system
- Add validation for foreign key relationships in master data models

## Next Steps
1. Begin implementing the Cloudinary image upload functionality
2. Integrate master data with the transaction form by implementing Combobox/Autocomplete
3. Implement the Organization Switcher UI component
4. Regenerate Prisma client to fix type issues with new models 


note:
when need anything about User Id or etc, use this: 
```
import { auth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";
const { userId, orgId } = await auth();
```

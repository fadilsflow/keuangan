## Implementation Notes
- All queries now filter by both organizationId and userId to ensure data isolation
- Added type extensions to handle fields not yet recognized by TypeScript
- For transactions and items, used type assertion to handle the new fields when TypeScript doesn't recognize them
- Test coverage is basic; should be expanded to cover all API endpoints
- Added proper error handling for cases when user is not authenticated or no organization is selected
- Used temporary type casting (prisma as any) for new models until Prisma client is regenerated

## Technical Debt
- Need to regenerate Prisma client types to properly include organizationId and userId and master data models
- Consider creating a helper function to handle the common auth checks across all API routes
- Improve type safety rather than using 'any' type assertions
- Add integration tests for the user+organization permission system
- Add validation for foreign key relationships in master data models

## Technical Considerations
- Use Clerk's organization management APIs:
  - GET /organizations/{organization_id} for fetching org details
  - POST /organizations for creating new organizations
  - PATCH /organizations/{organization_id} for updating org settings
  - GET /organizations/{organization_id}/memberships for member management
- Implement proper role-based access control (RBAC) for organization management
- Consider implementing organization-specific settings/preferences
- Use optimistic updates for better UX in organization switching
- Implement proper error boundaries for organization-related operations
- Consider implementing organization deletion with proper safeguards
- Add audit logging for important organization changes

## UI/UX Considerations
- Organization Creation:
  - Simple, focused form layout
  - Clear validation feedback
  - Progress indicator for multi-step process (if needed)
  
- Organization Switching:
  - Grid layout for organization cards
  - Clear visual hierarchy
  - Quick search/filter capability
  - Smooth transitions between organizations
  
- Organization Management:
  - Clear navigation between different settings
  - Proper confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
  - Responsive design for all screen sizes
  - Loading states for all async operations

## Next Steps
1. Begin implementing the organization middleware for flow control
2. Create the organization creation page with basic functionality
3. Implement the organization switcher UI with card layout
4. Develop the organization management dashboard
5. Add account management features
6. Begin implementing the Cloudinary image upload functionality
7. Integrate master data with the transaction form by implementing Combobox/Autocomplete
8. Regenerate Prisma client to fix type issues with new models 


note:
when need anything about User Id or etc, use this: 
```
import { auth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";
const { userId, orgId } = await auth();
```
